Display all the existent networks in the host:
$ docker network ls

Let's create a new bridge network:
$ docker network create -d bridge my-bridge-network


Run a container linked to the created network:

$ docker run -d -p 8081:8081 -e "port=8081" --name app --network=my-bridge-network <image name>


Find the container internal ip using:

$ docker inspect app

Open a new terminal windows and run an ubuntu container in interactive mode:

$ docker run -it --name client alpine:latest

Install curl in the client container:

$ apk --no-cache add curl  

From the client container terminal try to browse to the app container: (change the IP Address accordingly)

$ curl 172.21.0.2:8081 --connect-timeout 5

You will get no access and the connection will be terminated due to timeout

$ curl: (28) Connection timed out after 5000 milliseconds

From the regular terminal run the command below to attach the client container to the created network:

$ docker network connect my-bridge-network client

From the client container terminal try to browse to the app container again: (change the IP Address accordingly)

$ curl 172.21.0.2:8081 --connect-timeout 5
